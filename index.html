        <h1 class="about__headline">Webdeveloper, Photojournalist & Thinker.</h1>

        <p>After studying Sociology &amp; History, at University of Potsdam, I was searching for a language, to express all those thoughts that I had in mind about concepts analysing behavoir or people. I found a possibility in telling stories of everyday life, which are bigger than the particular situation. Later I studied <a href="http://www.fotostudenten.de/">Photojournalism & Documentary Photography</a> in the class of Rolf Nobel & Lars Bauernschmitt at the University of Applied Science and Arts in Hannover. After long nights drinking schnapps, we transformed the existing collective <a href="http://visual-rebellion.com/">visual-rebellion</a>, into a multimedia-collective, dedicated to progressive storytelling, called <a href="http://jib-collective.net/">jib-collective</a>. In June 2015 we published our fist common story "<a href="https://jib-collective.net/stories/mongolia/">The Silence of the Lambs</a>". My current photographic work deals with the the complex of racism, migration and social struggles.

        <p>In parallel, the small team of <a href="http://www.wienfluss.net/">WIENFLUSS</a>, one of the leading agencies in creating an accessible web in Austria, and Me drafted and implemented many websites, such as <a href="http://www.wien.info/">wien.info</a> (official Vienna Tourism Website), Bundeskanzleramt (Department of Federal Chancellor Austria), <abbr title="European Energy Award">EEA</abbr> & Enercoach (Assessing Europe's leading energy saving communities) and <a href="http://www.oenb.at/"><abbr title="Austrian National Bank">OeNB</abbr></a> (Austrian National Bank). I mainly worked on the User Experience Design, Accessibility and the frontend code.</p>
        
        <p>This experience lead me into several month of freelancing as a Developer. Working in a team with <a href="">Bildargumente</a> I created a new website for the <a href="http://alarmphone.org/">Alarmphone</a>, helped to create a succesful <a href="http://sea-watch.org/sea-watch2/">crowfunding campaign for Sea-Watch 2</a> and supported some students in Hannover in creating a website for the <a href="http://gafeisfabrik.de/">GAF</a> (gallery for photography).</p>
        
        <p>Well, all this was too much stress and too little teamwork, so I teamed up with the wonderful people of <a href="https://www.aboutsource.net/">about:source</a>. Together we launched a new website for <a href="https://www.proasyl.de/">Pro Asyl</a> in March 2016.
