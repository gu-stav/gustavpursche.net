        <h1 class="about__headline">Photojournalist, Webdeveloper & Thinker.</h1>

        <p>I studied Sociology and History at University of Potsdam. While learning about methods of analysing the world I was searching for a language, to express all those thoughts, which I had in mind. The answer I found in telling stories of everyday life, which tell more than just about this particular situation. Later I studied <a href="http://www.fotostudenten.de/">Photojournalism & Documentary Photography</a> in the class of Rolf Nobel & Lars Bauernschmitt at the University of Applied Science and Arts in Hannover. Later I joined the collective <a href="http://visual-rebellion.com/">visual-rebellion</a>, which we started to transform in 2015 into a multimedia-collective, dedicated to progressive storytelling, called <a href="http://jib-collective.net/">jib-collective</a>. In June 2015 we published our fist big story "<a href="https://jib-collective.net/stories/mongolia/">The Silence of the Lambs</a>". My current photographic work deals with the the complex of racism, migration and social struggles.

        <p>During my recent job, together with a small team I, consulted and programmed many websites, such as <a href="http://www.wien.info/">wien.info</a> (official Vienna Tourism Website), Bundeskanzleramt (Department of Federal Chancellor Austria), <abbr title="European Energy Award">EEA</abbr> & Enercoach (Assessing Europe's leading energy saving communities) and <a href="http://www.oenb.at/"><abbr title="Austrian National Bank">OeNB</abbr></a> (Austrian National Bank). For those I mainly did Frontend-Development, User Experience Design and Accessibility.</p>
